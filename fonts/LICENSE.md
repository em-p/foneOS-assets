# License
These fonts have custom licenses. Each sub-folder represents a different font. Inside the sub-folder is a file called "fontDesc.xml". This file contains information about the font's license, among other things, and the filename for a text file containing the full text of the license.

The fontDesc.xml file is used by foneOS to handle licenses and font names. It is required for every font.
